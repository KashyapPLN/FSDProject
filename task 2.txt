Differences between browser js and node js :

Browser JS                                                                                  Node JS

1. It is used on the client side.                                            1. It is used mostly on the server side. 

2. Javascript is capable enough to                                    2. Nodejs does not have capability to add HTML tags.
add HTML and play with the DOM.

3. It is used in the front end development.                        3. Nodejs is used in server-side development.

4. Javascript can run in any browser engine as               4. V8 is the Javascript engine inside of node.js that parses and runs Javascript.
    like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey
    in Firefox.

5. Moduling is not mandatory in Browser JS .                 5. In Node JS everything is a module. You must keep your code inside a module.


Summary :

1. The browser contains a html parser and css parser.

2. The html parser creates a DOM tree, whereas the CSS parser creates a CSSOM tree.

3.HTML parser doesn't stop parsing when there is an error. The HTML parsing isn't straightforward , can be halted and will do  speculative parsing.

4. The parsing flow is at first the text is converted into tokens, then tree is constructed and later DOM is created and then the script is executed.

5. A render tree is created from DOM tree and CSSOM tree.


1. Executing typeof(1) gives the type as number.

2. Executing typeof(1.1) gives the type as number.

3. Executing typeof('1.1') gives the type as string.

4. Executing typeof(true) gives the type as boolean.

5. Executing typeof(null) gives the type as object.

6. Executing typeof(undefined) gives the type as undefined.

7. Executing typeof([]) gives the type as object

8. Executing typeof({})  gives the type as object

9. Executing typeof(NaN) gives the type as number
